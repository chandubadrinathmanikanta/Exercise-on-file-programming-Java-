Hey Guys!
I'm Chandu studying at SRM University(2020-2024) currently in 4th semester and have been assigned a project 
where you can find the solutions of the assingnment.

I've assigned to Disk-D(in This PC), So save the java files and srm.txt file int the disk-d

Then it will be easier for you guys without changing any code.

If you want to change to your respective .txt file then save the file in disk-d and then

replace the filename in the code with your ones.

The questions which are given are attached to the repository.
